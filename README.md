<b>1. Introduction</b> <p>
This project integrates image classification and image generation techniques. It allows users to upload an image, classify it using a pre-trained model, and then use stable diffusion to generate related images based on the classification results.

<b>2. Features </b></p>
1. Upload images and classify them using a pre-trained neural network.
2. Generate related images using stable diffusion based on classification results.
3. Simple and easy-to-use interface on Google Colab.

<b>3.  Technologies Used </b></p>
1. Python
2. PyTorch
3. Torchvision
4. Google Colab
5. Stable Diffusion
